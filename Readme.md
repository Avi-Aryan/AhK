Themes (2 - one dark, one light)  

**Extra**  
Auto-Complete Adder (in Packages/AutoHotkey) to easily add more Auto-Completes.    

#### Tips ####
* Make sure to **change Autohotkey.sublime-build** according to your requirements.  
* Use Auto-Complete Adder to add custom Auto-completes.  
* Dont worry about two Msgbox's in Autocomplete. `<blank> ` is for  
`Msgbox,text 			;(used in testing)` whereas other is for the whole long command.
* Similarly Loop has 5 variants each for `general`, `reading files and folders` , `parsing a string`  
,`registry reading` and `reading lines from file` .
